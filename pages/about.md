I'm a computational neuroscientist interested in data-driven modeling of behavioral dynamics and its neural control.

Currently, I am a postdoc in Alex Cayco-Gajic's lab at Ecole Normale Sup√©rieure in Paris, where I am focusing on analyzing large-scale neural population recordings and modeling locomotor behavior in complex environments.
Before my postdoc, I earned my PhD from the Universitat de Barcelona. My doctoral work was under the supervision of Albert Compte, with whom I studied the role of NMDA receptor hypofunction in working memory performance and trial history biases.

Going forward, I want to center my research on proposing mathematical models of continous behavior. My long-term goal is to propose generative models of motor behavior and navigation in increasingly naturalistic contexts, and to use these models to identify target computations for the hypothesis-driven analysis of neural activity.
