I'm a computational neuroscientist interested in data-driven modeling of behavioral dynamics and its neural control. Currently, I am a postdoc in Alex Cayco-Gajic's lab at Ecole Normale Sup√©rieure in Paris, where I am focusing on analyzing large-scale neural population recordings and modeling locomotor behavior in complex environments.
Before my postdoc, I earned my PhD from the Universitat de Barcelona. My doctoral work was under the supervision of Albert Compte, with whom I studied the role of NMDA receptor hypofunction in working memory performance and trial history biases.
