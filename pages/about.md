I'm a computational neuroscientist interested in data-driven modeling of behavioral dynamics and its neural control.

Currently, I am a postdoc in Alex Cayco-Gajic's lab at Ecole Normale Sup√©rieure in Paris, where I focus on analyzing large-scale neural population recordings and modeling locomotor behavior in complex environments.
Before that, I earned my PhD from the Universitat de Barcelona. Under the supervision of Albert Compte I studied the role of NMDA receptor hypofunction in working memory performance and trial history biases.

Going forward, I will center my research on modeling behavioral time series. My long-term goal is to propose generative models of motor behavior and navigation in increasingly naturalistic contexts, and to use these models to identify target computations for the hypothesis-driven analysis of neural activity.
