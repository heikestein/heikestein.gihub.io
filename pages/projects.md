Over my PhD and postdoc, I have worked on a multitude of topics in cognitive, systems and computational neuroscience, ranging from working memory mechanisms in prefrontal cortex, NMDA-receptor related memory alterations in patient populations, novel techniques for dimensionality reduction of large-scale neural recordings, cerebellar interneuron activity during locomotion, to dynamical models of locomotor behavior. Despite the large variety of topics, my research has been guided throughout by a strong focus on linking brain activity to cognition and behavior.
