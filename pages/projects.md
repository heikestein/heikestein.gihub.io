Over my PhD and postdoc, I have explored a range of topics spanning attractor dynamics in working memory, computational psychiatry, novel dimensionality reduction techniques, and dynamical models of motor behavior. What all of these projects have in common is a strong focus on bridging brain activity with cognition and obervable behavior.
