Over my PhD and postdoc, I have worked on a multitude of topics in cognitive, systems and computational neuroscience, ranging from working memory mechanisms in prefrontal cortex, NMDA-receptor related memory alterations in patient populations, novel techniques for dimensionality reduction of large-scale neural recordings, cerebellar interneuron activity during locomotion, to dynamical models of locomotor behavior. Despite the large variety of topics, my research has been guided throughout by a strong focus on linking brain activity to cognition and behavior. 

Over the years, my interests expanded from rather abstract cognitive processes towards a more embodied perspective, currently focusing on motor control and motor learning. As a result of my research experience in both cognitive and motor neuroscience, I regard cognition and motor control as closely entangled and often overlapping.
