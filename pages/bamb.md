I am a co-organizer of the Barcelona Advanced Modeling of Behavior (BAMB!) summer school. [BAMB!](https://www.bambschool.org/) is a school for PhD students and postdocs who want to learn advanced techniques for the model-based analysis of behavior of humans and other animals. In a ten-day program, we mix lectures, talks, and hands-on tutorials and group projects. Our goal is to teach both the conceptual basis and the technical skills that will enable students to do their own modeling projects when back in their home lab.

The course takes place on a yearly basis, typically in late July (applications are closed for 2024). You can find course material (jupyter notebooks) from the previous year on our github page [<i class="fab fa-github"></i>](https://github.com/bambschool/BAMB2023/tree/main).
