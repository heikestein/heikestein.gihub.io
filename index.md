On this page you can find a short description of my [research interests](heikestein.github.io/about), as well as more in-depth summaries of my main current and previous [lines of research](heikestein.github.io/projects) and [papers](heikestein.github.io/papers) (in fact, you can download formatted papers in this tab too, and for some of my works you can find recorded talks, as well as openly available data and code). You can also access my [CV](heikestein.github.io/cv) and [contact information](heikestein.github.io/contact).
