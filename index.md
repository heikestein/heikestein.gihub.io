Hi, I'm Heike, a computational neuroscientist at ENS Paris. 

On this page you can find a short description of my [research interests](https://heikestein.github.io/about), as well as more in-depth summaries of my main current and previous [lines of research](https://heikestein.github.io/projects) and [papers](https://heikestein.github.io/papers) (in fact, you can download formatted papers in this tab too, and for some of my works you can find recorded talks, as well as openly available data and code). [BAMB!](https://heikestein.github.io/bamb) is a Barcelona-based summer school I am co-organizing. You can also access my [CV](https://heikestein.github.io/cv) and [contact information](https://heikestein.github.io/contact).
