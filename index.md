Hi, I'm Heike, a computational neuroscientist at Sorbonne Universit√© in Paris. 

On this page you can find a short description of my [research interests](https://heikestein.github.io/about), as well as more in-depth summaries of my main current and previous [lines of research](https://heikestein.github.io/projects) and [papers](https://heikestein.github.io/papers) (you can download formatted papers in this tab too, and for some of my work you can find recorded talks, openly available data, and code). If you're a neuroscientist interested in behavioral modeling, please check out [BAMB!](https://heikestein.github.io/bamb), a Barcelona-based summer school that I am co-organizing. You can also access my [CV](https://heikestein.github.io/cv) and [contact information](https://heikestein.github.io/contact).
